# solarcoinv2
cryptocurrency that is inspired by SolarCoin but tries to be better than it

# Acknowledgements

I am inspired to start this project as a result of discussions with a fellow netizen (gloryhunters@protonmail.com).

# Motivation
- Help solve the most pressing problem of our times by providing a massive incentive for renewable energy generation
- Demystify crytocurrency and make it a practical reality

# Design

1. Unlike the stated aims of many cryptocurrencies, solarcoinv2 embraces and infact depends on government support and hopes for recognition from the UN (United Nations). It is foolish to 'fight' with the government. Rather it requests the governments to perform a few very simple and specific duties, with great integrity.

2. Any renewable energy is convertible into SolarCoinV2. 1KWh of renewable energy = 1 SolarCoinV2 for all time to come.

3. In any day and age, currency must be backed by something useful for that day and age. Gold was the original successful currency. It was useful because it could actually be made into cooking utensils etc. As time went on gold became too scarce for such use. Hence it no longer backs currency. SolarCoinV2 is the global currency of choice for today's day and age, because the need in today's day and age is Renewable Energy. (To ensure that energy and not knowledge remains important, governments can consider distributing 3D printers that can literally manufacture anything commonly needed, to the general public. The printing programs could be downloaded for free over the internet).

4. SolarCoinV2 will use servers of (say) 7 government groups in 7 different continents of the world - Asia, Africa, Europe, North Americe, South America, Australia and (perhaps) Antarctica. Each server is capable of storing the bank balances of all the people in the world. These are enough servers and enough geographical distances between them to establish consensus-based trust. If not, more servers can be added. Another good number of servers to have is one for each country in the world. However having more servers will make transactions significantly slower to record and verify.

5. Government will issue public keys and private keys to citizens. So governments know the bank balances of their citizens; they need to verify income tax anyway. Beyond this, every attempt will be made by government and individuals to keep the mapping of public keys to people on a need-to-known basis, just like our bank account numbers at present. The 7 databases on the 7 servers will have a table with at least 2 columns: the public key and the bank balance amount. The value of the latter column is accessible only by the governments and the account owner.

6. Governments are responsible to allow purchase of renewable energy from their citizens. The governments must with great integrity and precision, ensure that the energy was indeed generated in a renewable manner and is of the said quantity. In return for the energy, the governments credit the account on all 7 servers with SolarCoinV2. The message is digitally signed by the crediting government. Governments from other countries and from the UN can act as watchdogs in this process of renewable energy purchase from the public.

7. People transfer SolarCoinV2 from their accounts to others' by sending digitally signed messages signed with their private key to all 7 servers to credit SolarCoinV2 from their account to the public keys of another account. All 7 servers adjust the account balances accordingly.

8. No need of mining, PoW, PoS and all such electric-power-hungry complex and troubling concepts. People can check all 7 servers (they can connect to these servers over https and these servers will use the usual SSL certificates that we use to trust netbanking websites etc.)  They must send a request to check their bank balance that is digitally signed with their private key. Only then will the servers respond with information about their bank balance. This will help hackers from discovering which public key has how much balance. 

9. Just like one person can have multiple bank accounts, governments may offer this facility to their citizens so that for security reasons, any one account does not contain too much money.
